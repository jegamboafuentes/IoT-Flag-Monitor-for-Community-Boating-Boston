# IoT-Flag-Monitor-for-Community-Boating-Boston
 This repository contains the code for an IoT device that monitors real-time sailing conditions at Community Boating in Boston. The device, powered by a T-Display ESP32 development board, fetches flag color and status data from the Community Boating API and displays it on a small TFT screen. The project was designed to simplify the process of checking sailing conditions, providing an at-a-glance view of the current flag status. Perfect for sailors looking to automate their routine!
